# 1.0 Overview

**Geographically weighted regression (GWR)** is a spatial statistical technique that takes non-stationary variables into consideration (e.g., climate; demographic factors; physical environment characteristics) and models the local relationships between these independent variables and an outcome of interest (also known as dependent variable). In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to build [hedonic pricing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedonicpricing.asp) models by using GWR methods. The dependent variable is the resale prices of condominium in 2015. The independent variables are divided into either structural and locational.

## 1.1 The Data

Two data sets will be used in this model building exercise, they are:

-   URA Master Plan subzone boundary in shapefile format (i.e. *MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL*)

-   condo_resale_2015 in csv format (i.e. *condo_resale_2015.csv*)

## 1.2 Getting Started

The code chunks below installs and launches the necessary R packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(olsrr, corrplot, ggpubr, sf, spdep, GWmodel, tmap, tidyverse, gtsummary)
```

# 2.0 Geospatial Data Wrangling 

The code chunk below is used to import *MP_SUBZONE_WEB_PL* shapefile by using `st_read()` of **sf** packages.

```{r}
mpsz = st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

```{r}
#Updating CRS
mpsz_svy21 <- st_transform(mpsz, 3414)
st_crs(mpsz_svy21)
```

Notice that the EPSG: is indicated as *3414* now.

Next, you will reveal the extent of *mpsz_svy21* by using `st_bbox()` of sf package.

```{r}
st_bbox(mpsz_svy21) 
```

# 3.0 Aspatial Data Wrangling 

The *condo_resale_2015* is in csv file format. The codes chunk below uses `read_csv()` function of **readr** package to import *condo_resale_2015* into R as a tibble data frame called *condo_resale*.

```{r}
condo_resale = read_csv("data/aspatial/Condo_resale_2015.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(condo_resale)
```

```{r}
summary(condo_resale)
```

## 4.1 Converting Aspatial Data Frame into an sf object

Currently, the *condo_resale* tibble data frame is aspatial. We will convert it to a **sf** object. The code chunk below converts condo_resale data frame into a simple feature data frame by using `st_as_sf()` of **sf** packages.

```{r}
condo_resale.sf <- st_as_sf(condo_resale,
                            coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"),
                            crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs=3414)
```

Notice that `st_transform()` of **sf** package is used to convert the coordinates from wgs84 (i.e. crs:4326) to svy21 (i.e. crs=3414).

Next, `head()` is used to list the content of *condo_resale.sf* object.

```{r}
head(condo_resale.sf)
```

# 4.0 EDA

## 4.1 EDA Using Statistical Graphs

We can plot the distribution of *SELLING_PRICE* by using appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")
```

The figure above reveals a right skewed distribution. This means that more condominium units were transacted at relative lower prices.

Statistically, the skewed dsitribution can be normalised by using log transformation. The code chunk below is used to derive a new variable called *LOG_SELLING_PRICE* by using a log transformation on the variable *SELLING_PRICE*. It is performed using `mutate()` of **dplyr** package.

```{r}
condo_resale.sf <- condo_resale.sf %>%
  mutate(`LOG_SELLING_PRICE` = log(SELLING_PRICE))

```

Now, you can plot the *LOG_SELLING_PRICE* using the code chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`LOG_SELLING_PRICE`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")
```

## 4.2 Multiple Histogram Plots distribution of variables 

The code chunk below is used to create 12 histograms. Then, `ggarrange()` is used to organised these histogram into a 3 columns by 4 rows small multiple plot.

```{r}
AREA_SQM <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `AREA_SQM`)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

AGE <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `AGE`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_CBD <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_CBD`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_CHILDCARE <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_CHILDCARE`)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_ELDERLYCARE <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_ELDERLYCARE`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, 
                               aes(x= `PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_HAWKER_MARKET <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_HAWKER_MARKET`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_KINDERGARTEN <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_KINDERGARTEN`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_MRT <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_MRT`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_PARK <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_PARK`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_PRIMARY_SCH <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_PRIMARY_SCH`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH <- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, 
                               aes(x= `PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black", fill="light blue")

ggarrange(AREA_SQM, AGE, PROX_CBD, PROX_CHILDCARE, PROX_ELDERLYCARE, 
          PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA, PROX_HAWKER_MARKET, PROX_KINDERGARTEN, PROX_MRT,
          PROX_PARK, PROX_PRIMARY_SCH, PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH,  
          ncol = 3, nrow = 4)
```

## 4.3 Drawing Statistical Point Map 

Lastly, we want to reveal the geospatial distribution condominium resale prices in Singapore. The map will be prepared by using **tmap** package.

First, we will turn on the interactive mode of tmap by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
```

```{r}
tmap_options(check.and.fix=TRUE)
tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+
  tm_polygons() +
tm_shape(condo_resale.sf) +  
  tm_dots(col = "SELLING_PRICE",
          alpha = 0.6,
          style="quantile") +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))
```

Notice that [`tm_dots()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/2.2/topics/tm_symbols) is used instead of `tm_bubbles()`.

`set.zoom.limits` argument of `tm_view()` sets the minimum and maximum zoom level to 11 and 14 respectively.

Before moving on to the next section, the code below will be used to turn R display into `plot` mode.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

# 5.0 Hedonic Pricing Modelling in R

## 5.1 Simple Linear Regression Method

First, we will build a simple linear regression model by using *SELLING_PRICE* as the dependent variable and *AREA_SQM* as the independent variable.

```{r}
condo.slr <- lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)
```

`lm()` returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm”, “lm”).

The functions `summary()` and `anova()` can be used to obtain and print a summary and analysis of variance table of the results. The generic accessor functions coefficients, effects, fitted.values and residuals extract various useful features of the value returned by `lm`.

```{r}
summary(condo.slr)
```

The output report reveals that the SELLING_PRICE can be explained by using the formula:

```         
      *y = -258121.1 + 14719x1*
```

The R-squared of 0.4518 reveals that the simple regression model built is able to explain about 45% of the resale prices.

Since p-value is much smaller than 0.0001, we will reject the null hypothesis that mean is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE. This will allow us to infer that simple linear regression model above is a good estimator of *SELLING_PRICE*.

The **Coefficients:** section of the report reveals that the p-values of both the estimates of the Intercept and ARA_SQM are smaller than 0.001. In view of this, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a results, we will be able to infer that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.

To visualise the best fit curve on a scatterplot, we can incorporate `lm()` as a method function in ggplot’s geometry as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf,  
       aes(x=`AREA_SQM`, y=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

Figure above reveals that there are a few statistical outliers with relatively high selling prices.

## 5.2 Multiple Linear Regression Method

### 5.2.1 Visualizing relationships of independent variables 

Before building a multiple regression model, it is important to ensure that the indepdent variables used are not highly correlated to each other. If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as **multicollinearity** in statistics.

Correlation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the `pairs()` of R, there are many packages support the display of a correlation matrix. In this section, the [**corrplot**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html) package will be used.

The code chunk below is used to plot a scatterplot matrix of the relationship between the independent variables in *condo_resale* data.frame.

```{r}
corrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = "AOE",
         tl.pos = "td", tl.cex = 0.5, method = "number", type = "upper")
```

From the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that ***Freehold*** is highly correlated to ***LEASE_99YEAR***. In view of this, it is wiser to only include either one of them in the subsequent model building. As a result, ***LEASE_99YEAR*** is excluded in the subsequent model building.

## 5.3 Building a hedonic pricing model using multiple linear regression method 

The code chunk below using `lm()` to calibrate the multiple linear regression model.

```{r}
condo.mlr <- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE    + 
                  PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +
                  PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_HAWKER_MARKET + PROX_KINDERGARTEN + 
                  PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + 
                  PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_SUPERMARKET + 
                  PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, 
                data=condo_resale.sf)
summary(condo.mlr)
```

## 5.4 Preparing publication quality table: oslrr method

With reference to the report above, it is clear that not all the independent variables are statistically significant. We will revised the model by removing those variables which are not statistically significant.

Now, we are ready to calibrate the revised model by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
condo.mlr1 <- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + 
                   PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +
                   PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + 
                   PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL    + PROX_BUS_STOP + 
                   NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD,
                 data=condo_resale.sf)
ols_regress(condo.mlr1)
```

## 5.5 Preparing publication quality table: gtsummary method 

The [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html) package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready summary tables in R.

In the code chunk below, [`tbl_regression()`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_regression.html) is used to create a well formatted regression report.

```{r}
tbl_regression(condo.mlr1, intercept=TRUE)
```

With gtsummary package, model statistics can be included in the report by either appending them to the report table by using [`add_glance_table()`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/add_glance.html) or adding as a table source note by using [`add_glance_source_note()`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/add_glance.html) as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
tbl_regression(condo.mlr1, 
               intercept = TRUE) %>% 
  add_glance_source_note(
    label = list(sigma ~ "\U03C3"),
    include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, 
                AIC, statistic,
                p.value, sigma))
```

### 5.5.1 Checking for multicolinearity

In this section, we would like to introduce you a fantastic R package specially programmed for performing OLS regression. It is called [**olsrr**](https://olsrr.rsquaredacademy.com/). It provides a collection of very useful methods for building better multiple linear regression models:

-   comprehensive regression output

-   residual diagnostics

-   measures of influence

-   heteroskedasticity tests

-   collinearity diagnostics

-   model fit assessment

-   variable contribution assessment

-   variable selection procedures

In the code chunk below, the [`ols_vif_tol()`](https://olsrr.rsquaredacademy.com/reference/ols_coll_diag.html) of **olsrr** package is used to test if there are sign of multicollinearity.

```{r}
ols_vif_tol(condo.mlr1)
```

### 5.5.2 Tests for Non-Linearity

In multiple linear regression, it is important for us to test the assumption that linearity and additivity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

In the code chunk below, the [`ols_plot_resid_fit()`](https://olsrr.rsquaredacademy.com/reference/ols_plot_resid_fit.html) of **olsrr** package is used to perform linearity assumption test.

```{r}
ols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)
```

### 5.5.3 Test for Normality Assumption 

Lastly, the code chunk below uses [`ols_plot_resid_hist()`](https://olsrr.rsquaredacademy.com/reference/ols_plot_resid_hist.html) of *olsrr* package to perform normality assumption test.

```{r}
ols_plot_resid_hist(condo.mlr1)
```

The figure reveals that the residual of the multiple linear regression model (i.e. condo.mlr1) is resemble normal distribution.

## 5.5.4 Testing for Spatial Autocorrelation 

The hedonic model we try to build are using geographically referenced attributes, hence it is also important for us to visual the residual of the hedonic pricing model.

In order to perform spatial autocorrelation test, we need to convert *condo_resale.sf* from sf data frame into a **SpatialPointsDataFrame**.

First, we will export the residual of the hedonic pricing model and save it as a data frame.

```{r}
mlr.output <- as.data.frame(condo.mlr1$residuals)

#next we join th edata with condo_resale.sf object
condo_resale.res.sf <- cbind(condo_resale.sf, 
                        condo.mlr1$residuals) %>%
rename(`MLR_RES` = `condo.mlr1.residuals`)

#we convert condo_resales into sp data frame
condo_resale.sp <- as_Spatial(condo_resale.res.sf)
condo_resale.sp
```

Next, we will use **tmap** package to display the distribution of the residuals on an interactive map.

The code churn below will turn on the interactive mode of tmap.

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
```

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+
  tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) +
  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.4) +
tm_shape(condo_resale.res.sf) +  
  tm_dots(col = "MLR_RES",
          alpha = 0.6,
          style="quantile") +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

The figure above reveal that there is sign of spatial autocorrelation.

To proof that our observation is indeed true, the Moran’s I test will be performed

First, we will compute the distance-based weight matrix by using [`dnearneigh()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/dnearneigh.html) function of **spdep**.

```{r}
nb <- dnearneigh(coordinates(condo_resale.sp), 0, 1500, longlat = FALSE)
summary(nb)
```

Next, [`nb2listw()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nb2listw.html) of **spdep** packge will be used to convert the output neighbours lists (i.e. nb) into a spatial weights.

```{r}
nb_lw <- nb2listw(nb, style = 'W')
summary(nb_lw)
```

Next, [`lm.morantest()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/lm.morantest.html) of **spdep** package will be used to perform Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation

```{r}
lm.morantest(condo.mlr1, nb_lw)
```

The Global Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation shows that it’s p-value is less than 0.00000000000000022 which is less than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence, we will reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are randomly distributed.

Since the Observed Global Moran I = 0.1424418 which is greater than 0, we can infer than the residuals resemble cluster distribution.

# 6.0 Building Hedonic Pricing Models using GWModel

## 6.1 Building Fixed Bandwidth GWR Model 

### 6.1.1 Computing fixed bandwidth

In the code chunk below `bw.gwr()` of GWModel package is used to determine the optimal fixed bandwidth to use in the model. Notice that the argument ***adaptive*** is set to **FALSE** indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.

```{r}
bw.fixed <- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + 
                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + 
                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + 
                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + 
                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, 
                   data=condo_resale.sp, 
                   approach="CV", 
                   kernel="gaussian", 
                   adaptive=FALSE, 
                   longlat=FALSE)
```

### 6.1.2 GWModel method - fixed bandwidth

Now we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.

```{r}
gwr.fixed <- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + 
                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + 
                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + 
                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + 
                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, 
                       data=condo_resale.sp, 
                       bw=bw.fixed, 
                       kernel = 'gaussian', 
                       longlat = FALSE)
```

The output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”. The code below can be used to display the model output.

```{r}
gwr.fixed
```

## 6.2 Building Adaptive Bandwidth GWR Model 

### 6.2.1 Computing the adaptive bandwidth

The code chunk used look very similar to the one used to compute the fixed bandwidth except the `adaptive` argument has changed to **TRUE**.

```{r}
bw.adaptive <- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE  + 
                        PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE    + 
                        PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + 
                        PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL   + PROX_BUS_STOP + 
                        NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, 
                      data=condo_resale.sp, 
                      approach="CV", 
                      kernel="gaussian", 
                      adaptive=TRUE, 
                      longlat=FALSE)
```

30 is the recommended bandwidth to use.

## Adaptive Bandwidth

Now, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
gwr.adaptive <- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + 
                            PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + 
                            PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + 
                            PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + 
                            NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, 
                          data=condo_resale.sp, bw=bw.adaptive, 
                          kernel = 'gaussian', 
                          adaptive=TRUE, 
                          longlat = FALSE)
gwr.adaptive
```

The report shows that the AICc the adaptive distance gwr is 41982.22 which is even smaller than the AICc of the fixed distance gwr of 42263.61.

## 6.3 Converting SDF into sf data.frame

In addition to regression residuals, the output feature class table includes fields for observed and predicted y values, condition number (cond), Local R2, residuals, and explanatory variable coefficients and standard errors:

-   Condition Number: this diagnostic evaluates local collinearity. In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.

-   Local R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.

-   Predicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.

-   Residuals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.

-   Coefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.

They are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its “data” slot in an object called **SDF** of the output list.

To visualise the fields in **SDF**, we need to first covert it into **sf** data.frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
condo_resale.sf.adaptive <- st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %>%
  st_transform(crs=3414)
```

```{r}
condo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 <- st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive, 3414)
condo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21  
```

```{r}
gwr.adaptive.output <- as.data.frame(gwr.adaptive$SDF)
condo_resale.sf.adaptive <- cbind(condo_resale.res.sf, as.matrix(gwr.adaptive.output))
```

```{r}
summary(gwr.adaptive$SDF$yhat)
```

## 6.4 Visualizing local R2

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+
  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +
tm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  
  tm_dots(col = "Local_R2",
          border.col = "gray60",
          border.lwd = 1) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

## 6.5 Visualizing coefficient estimates

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
AREA_SQM_SE <- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+
  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +
tm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  
  tm_dots(col = "AREA_SQM_SE",
          border.col = "gray60",
          border.lwd = 1) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))

AREA_SQM_TV <- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+
  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +
tm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  
  tm_dots(col = "AREA_SQM_TV",
          border.col = "gray60",
          border.lwd = 1) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))

tmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, 
             asp=1, ncol=2,
             sync = TRUE)
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

### 6.5.1 By URA Planning Region 

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_svy21[mpsz_svy21$REGION_N=="CENTRAL REGION", ])+
  tm_polygons()+
tm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) + 
  tm_bubbles(col = "Local_R2",
           size = 0.15,
           border.col = "gray60",
           border.lwd = 1)
```
