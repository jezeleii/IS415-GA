# 1.0 Objective & Overview

## Spatial Weights & Applications 

-   There can be a lot of robust discussions surrounding statistical analysis of Spatial weights, which assesses the strength of interaction (combined effect of correlation coefficient and weights)

# 2.0 Installing Packages

For the purpose of this study, six R packages will be used. They are:

-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) provides functions for importing processing and wrangling geospatial data,,

-   [**raster**](https://rspatial.org/raster/) for handling raster data in R,

-   [**spatstat**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/index.html) for performing Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kcross, Lcross, etc.,

-   [**sparr**](https://tilmandavies.github.io/sparr/index.html) provides functions to estimate fixed and adaptive kernel-smoothed spatial relative risk surfaces via the density-ratio method and perform subsequent inference. Fixed-bandwidth spatiotemporal density and relative risk estimation is also supported

-   [**tmap**](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) provides functions to produce cartographic quality thematic maps, and

-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a family of R packages that provide functions to perform common data science tasks including and not limited to data import, data transformation, data wrangling and data visualisation.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf,raster,spatstat,sparr,tmap,tidyverse,readr, dplyr, animation)
```

# 3.0 Importing and Preparing Study Area

In this exercise, we will use the following datasets:

-   forestfires, a csv file provides locations of forest fire detected from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor data. The data are downloaded from [Fire Information for Resource Management System](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/). For the purpose of this exercise, only forest fires within Kepulauan Bangka Belitung will be used.

-   Kepulauan_Bangka_Belitung, an ESRI shapefile showing the sub-district (i.e.Â [kelurahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villages_of_Indonesia)) boundary of Kepulauan Bangka Belitung. The data set was downloaded from [Indonesia Geospatial](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2023/05/download-shapefile-batas-administrasi.html) portal. The original data covers the whole Indonesia. For the purpose of this exercise, only sub-districts within Kepulauan Bangka Belitung are extracted.
