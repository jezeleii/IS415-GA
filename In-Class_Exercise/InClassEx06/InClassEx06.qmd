# 1.0 Objective & Overview

By the end to this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:

-   import geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of **sf** package,

-   import csv file using appropriate function of **readr** package,

-   perform relational join using appropriate join function of **dplyr** package,

-   compute spatial weights using appropriate functions of **spdep** package, and

-   calculate spatially lagged variables using appropriate functions of **spdep** package.

-   GWModel

# 2.0 The Study Area and Data

Two data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:

-   Hunan county boundary layer. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.

-   Hunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunanâ€™s local development indicators in 2012.

Before we get started, we need to ensure that **spdep**, **sf**, **tmap** and **tidyverse** packages of R are currently installed in your R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse, knitr, GWmodel )
```
